## About

This is a thing a few friends of mine and I always wanted to create: A L4D2 campaign. There will be more details once the project grows.

## Installation

A detailed installation tutorial (and probably an installer) will be added in the future.

## Download

You can find a download link to the campaign in the [Releases Section]().

Note that the there are multiple different kind of releases ranging from tests to blocking to fully fledged scenes to the final product. We will go into more details once the work on the campaign has started.

## Building

The campaign is built and shipped with the L4D2 Authoring tools. However, there will be a build-tool that is included to build the vmf files into bsp, as well as packaging them as vpks.

## Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is by playing the game and reporting issues. You can also work on assets, code or write on the documentation of the project. Anything helps and is appreciated.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project will be split into two parts: The presentation of the game will be shown in GitHub pages to the public to link to from external pages. A technical documentation will be available in the wiki of this project.
